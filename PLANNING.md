## Plan

Overall time of the event is 3-4 hours plus lunch break at the canteen in the middle.

1. Foreword. Couple of words about the University, about room setup, about plan.
2. Introduction. Discussion about Chip Design School.
3. Presentation to the ALU Task. Explanation of the class planning.
4. Theoretical part.
5. Practical part.

### Theoretical part plan

1. Discuss about microelectronics and digital circuit design.
2. Basics on combinational and sequential logic.
3. Basics on HDL in general and SystemVerilog in particular. Three ways to execute Verilog: sim, fpga, asic.
4. Theory on binary numbers, two's bit complement, adder/subtractor.
5. Theory on equality.
6. Theory on binary multiplicator.

### Practical part plan
